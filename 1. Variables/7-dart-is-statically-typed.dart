void main() {
  var greet = 'hello';
  greet = 'bye';
//   greet = 1;

dynamic a = 100;
a = 'Pakistan';
print(a);

}

/*
hello or bye or anything that's inside a set of single quotes will work just fine.

But we can't change the data type of this variable.

we can't change it to 123.

In JS you can do it as it is a dynamic programming language.

Now this is what we mean when we say that Dart is a statically typed language.

If it was a dynamically type language and there's many of those out there, then this would be a perfectly

valid thing to do and it won't complain at all.
